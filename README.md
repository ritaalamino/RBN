# RBN
Random Boolean Network C++

This implementation uses adjacency matrix. A graph representation for the boolean network.
The conex_Graph it's the connection matrix
Vector it's the logic vector matrix for connections.
H_States it's a historic matrix for comparison between to networks.
Vertex_Node it's the networks node state.

Prob_Graph it's a probability matrix between 0.0 and 1.0. Still working on that.
